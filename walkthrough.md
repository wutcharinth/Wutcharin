# Walkthrough - Wutcharin Portfolio Migration (Phase 2 Complete)

I have successfully migrated your portfolio to a modern **React + Vite** application and implemented "Phase 2" enhancements for a world-class interactive experience.

## Phase 2 Enhancements

### 1. Advanced 3D Interactivity
- **Skills Cloud**: A fully interactive 3D sphere of your technical skills (Python, React, AI, etc.) that users can rotate and explore.
- **Network Mesh Background**: Upgraded the background to a complex particle system with subtle rotation, symbolizing global connectivity and data networks.

### 2. Premium UX Features
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Implemented `lenis` for a luxurious, heavy-weight scroll feel typical of high-end agency sites.
- **Typewriter Effect**: Dynamic text in the Hero section cycling through "Executive Leader", "Data Strategist", etc.

### 3. Core Migration (Recap)
- **Framework**: React 19 + Vite + TypeScript.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4.
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for all entrance and hover effects.

## Verification Results

### Build Status
- `npm run build` completed successfully.
- All dependencies (including `lenis` and `three`) are correctly linked.

### Performance
- The application is optimized for production.
- 3D elements use efficient instancing to maintain high FPS.

## Next Steps
- Run `npm run dev` to preview the new interactive elements.
- Deploy to Vercel to share with the world.
